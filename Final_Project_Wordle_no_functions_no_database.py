# This is a draft. It still needs to be converted into a format that includes functions.
# Also, there needs to be a list of words for the program to randomly select from.
# (In the meantime, feel free to change the word given in the word = "hello" statement.
# Make sure it's still 5 letters long. Repeated letters make for interesting cases!)
# This list will also be used to verify that user-input guesses are actual words.
# The code for that will look something like this:
# word_list = (whatever text file has been read by the program)
# word = word_list[rand.range(0, len(word_list))]
#real_word = False
#for w in range(len(word_list)):
#    if guess == word_list[w]:
#        real_word = True
#if real_word == False:
#    print("Your guess, " + guess + ", is not a word.\nPlease try again:")
#else:
#    (rest of code)
word = "hello" # This line will be removed once the list of words is incorporated.
# Maybe add a list of words of your choosing and have the program pick one randomly when you begin a game.
